## Experience
<p>I struggled quite a lot with this project since it was difficult to get a sense of how React works at first. It was difinitely
a very high learning curve. However, once I understood the concenpts, I was able to follow the patterns and understand it better.
I enjoyed learning animations and 3D effects through this project.</p>
